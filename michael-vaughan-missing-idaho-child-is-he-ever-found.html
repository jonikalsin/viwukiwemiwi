He was last spotted playing with his Nintendo in his living room.</p><p>Michael was last seen wearing a blue Minecraft t-shirt, dark blue briefs, and flip-flops. He was five years old at the time of his disappearance.</p><p>Brandy Neal, Michael’s mother, was at work when she received a call from her husband, Tyler Vaughan, informing her that Michael was missing, to which she returned home.</p><p>Searches began immediately, and the community gathered to look for Michael with the police in farm fields, streets, shrubs, and storm drains.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/modelfact.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Michael-Vaughan-Missing-3.png><p>The disappearance of Michael Vaughan has devastated the Fruitland community. Authorities have been looking for Michael for several months and have not found him.</p><p>The police investigation into Michael’s disappearance has been thorough, with numerous leads and information being pursued.</p><p>Fruitland also came together to help Michael’s family during this challenging time. Several vigils and prayer services have been held in his honor, with community members offering their support and prayers for his safe return.</p><p>Even after almost two years of his disappearance, the community still hopes Michael will be located and returned to his family soon.</p><h2>Is Michael Vaughan Ever Found?</h2><p>Fruitland Police Chief JD Huff believes Michael Vaughan is deceased, although no remains have been recovered. Many people are wondering if Michael will ever be found.</p><p>Hartmann, the Senior Director of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children’s (NCMEC) Missing Children Division, pointed out that more than 90% of missing children are located, whether&nbsp;quickly or takes some time.</p><p>However, she mentioned that stranger abductions are highly rare, and what occurred to Michael was unusual.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/modelfact.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Michael-Vaughan-Missing-2.png><p>The hunt for Michael’s remains has been ongoing, and Fruitland Police began examining the backyard of a residence near Michael’s home on Saturday, November 12, 2022.</p><p>On November 14, 2022, police arrested Sarah Wondra, who lives at the home police have been searching. Chief Huff told the media that there was a high likelihood of remains on the site.&nbsp;</p><p>Sarah was accused of failing to notify the coroner of a death. On November 21, a judge ruled that she was mentally unable to stand trial and rescheduled her court dates.</p><p>Her status meeting had been rescheduled for December 23, which was again postponed, although no remains were found buried or in any other condition, even after an extensive property search.</p><p>On Friday, August 19, 2022, the Fruitland Police Department and the Idaho Missing Persons Clearinghouse announced they would collaborate with Washington State’s Homeward Bound program to find Michael Vaughan.</p><p>The Homeward Bound Project distributes photographs of missing individuals on semi-trailers traveling across North America to generate leads.</p><h2>Michael Vaughan Missing Update 2023</h2><p>There have been no significant developments in the search for Michael Vaughan as of March 2023.</p><p>Sarah Wondra, the woman accused of failing to notify police of Michael’s death, is currently being evaluated for competency to stand trial by the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. Her next court appearance is scheduled on March 20, 2023.</p><p>Meanwhile, Michael’s mother, Brandy Neal, continues to make public pleas for information and assistance in her son’s abduction.</p><p>“I don’t understand why that day was so different,” Neal stated in a December 12, 2021, interview. “One minute he’s here, people see him, and the next he’s gone.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/modelfact.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Michael-Vaughan-Missing-1.png><p>Neal has tirelessly advocated for her son since he first went missing in July 2021. She has made several public calls for information and has spoken to the media numerous times.</p><p>Neal has also been instrumental in the passage of Monkey’s Law, the new missing person alert system established in honor of Michael.</p><p>This law could prove critical&nbsp;in locating missing children and preventing other families from going through the same trauma as the Vaughans.</p><p>The search for Michael continues, and authorities are looking into the matter. Despite the lack of progress in locating Michael, the community remains hopeful.</p><p>Neal and her family have received an outpouring of community support, and people are still looking for Michael and hoping he will be found one day.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong> <a href=#>Elle King Sister Half Siblings Miranda Schneider And Madeline Schneider</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiln5myrbLAnKtnm5%2BifK61wqGYnqRdq662s8eapWalmajAqrrGZqCdmZikeqS0yKWbZqGjYrWmecSvnKtllqTCr7CO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./enchong-dee.html><span>←</span><span>Enchong Dee</span></a>
