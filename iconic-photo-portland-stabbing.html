“Give it up for love” are surprising words to hear from a mother whose child was recently stabbed to death by a stranger.
But that’s what Asha Deliverance instructed attendees at a vigil for her son, Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, who was recently murdered while protecting two young Muslim women — one black, one wearing a hijab — during a hate-fueled attack on a Portland train."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
