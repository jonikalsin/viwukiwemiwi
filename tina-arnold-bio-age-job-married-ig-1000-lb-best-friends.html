Every single one of them has their reason whether it is to look good or to be alive so that family doesn’t have to endure the pain of them going away before time.</p><p>In the preview of the show, Vannessa introduces herself and her friend Meghan. Friends since senior high, they got each others’ back. Tired of all the bullying and for the sake of their children, they have shown determination to shed some weight. However, it surely isn’t going to be easy, so Vannessa also tapped their two friends Tina and Ashley to come along on the journey.</p><p>Not only Ashley and Tina are appearing on the show as their motivators, but they are also trying to lose weight.</p><p>As stressful as it is, nobody says “oversized” girls can’t have fun. We see Tina on the preview threatening to duct-tape Vanessa’s mouth in the heat of the moment. But, she is shown emotional when she talks to Meghan when she says, “My biggest fear is me leaving my kids alone without me,”</p><p>But, viewers are promised the inevitable drama which we see at the end of the preview. Based on Ashley’s <a href=#>tweet</a>, she has been a fan of TLC’s show ‘My 600lb Life’ never knowing one day she would get to star on a reality show with a similar theme.</p><p>About Tina and Meghan’s history, you should know that they have known each other when Meghan was only 15. So, they have 3 decades-old friendship behind them. Meghan wrote on her Facebook, “I have some of the best friends a person could ever hope for.&nbsp;I know you have all met Vannessa TooLarge.

We also go way back to my age 15.”</p><p>As a testament to her long-lasting friendship, Tina also posted on her Instagram, “Most marriages don’t even last 27 years these days… but that’s just how long this chick has been dealing with my bs. I don’t say it as much as I should, ’cause I’m a hardass – but I’m super proud of her and thankful to have her in my life.”</p><h3><strong>Tina Arnold Weight Loss Journey</strong></h3><p>Tina was hinting at her weight loss journey since July 2021.

For eight long months, she worked hard to learn all she could about health and nutrition, giving herself a wellness education she had never had any interest in before.</p><p>However, in 2021, Tina weighed over 300 lbs again and revealed that she was starting over again.

We’ve been through it all and he’s never faltered in his love for me. He’s here for me when I need him the most, he makes me laugh and he lets me ugly cry on him when I just need to let it all out. He’s kinda cool, I guess – in a computer geek, Star Wars loving (obsessed) kinda way… he’s a’ight.”</p><p>Tina and her husband, Johnnie tied the knots in October 2002. She celebrated her 19th wedding anniversary on 17 October 2021 with an Ig post.
