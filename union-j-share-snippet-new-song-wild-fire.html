Casey Johnson left Union J this year meaning the group were once again one man down.</p><p>But the lads quickly dusted themselves off and vowed to continue as a three-piece which is what they were originally when they auditioned for the X Factor as a trio called Triple J back in 2012. So JJ Hamblett, Josh Cuthbert, and Jaymi Hensley are now working on a new album which is due for release early next year.</p><p>But while that may seem like a long way away, fans of Union J needn’t be too upset as the trio plan to release a new single before the end of August with another record due to drop before the end of the year.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I hate to tease but…….Saturday night listening to our new music is Soooooooo Damn Good !!! ????</p><p>— Union J (@UnionJworld) <a href=#>May 27, 2017</a></p><p>And JJ has shared a snippet of one of the tracks today.
