The teenager allegedly killed his friend but points to an officer instead.</p><p class=Zg>Lakeith Smith, 18 years of age, was charged and sentenced to 65 years in prison for killing his friend, A’Donte Washington in Alabama. Originally, he was given a plea deal of 26 years, but after received 65 years. To make matters worse, the murder was not committed by the teen, but by an Alabama, police officer.</p><p class=Zg>According to different news channels, Smith was one of some teens who attempted a robbery in houses located at Millbrook. The response of the officers was quick, and one of Smiths apprentice fired the first shot, which escalated to a shootout between the robbers and the policemen.</p><p class=Zg>The incident happened in 2015 but sparked fury on the internet today for being posted on the social media platform Twitter. User @okayplayer tweeted the news and quickly got responses from different people talking about injustice.</p><p class=Zg>Twitter user @SwitchedgearZ shared his thoughts through a response saying “He was 15 years old. He shouldn't have been tried as an adult. He was a minor under the "age of majority." He should have been tried in court as a juvenile, but he's black and the cop killed his friend. So someone had to take the fall. And although I agree that if you broke the law, and you were caught attempting to rob a place you should face the repercussions. However, 65 years for a 15yo juvenile is excessive! And the cop that killed the person walks free?! I don't see the "Justice."</p><p class=Zg>Additionally, some people raised the fact that Smith was a black American teen, which is widely known in America to have a harsher and unjust treatment, especially when violating the law. Jeree Thomas, director of Campaign for Youth Justice, spoke out saying,</p><p class=Zg>“This is certainly an uncommon case. The defendant’s accomplice wasn’t even involved in the killing, it was a third-party, but they prosecuted him anyway.”</p><p class=Zg>As was mentioned by Thomas, cases like these are no longer new in the area. There are seminars that teach young black Americas, as young as the age of 4 or 5, to respond in a certain manner when confronted by a police officer, just because of their skin color. Certainly, there is still a form of discrimination circulating in America.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmppbnBianq0wM6rsGaslZq7br%2FEp6ueppOasW5%2Fj2awnpmiqHqxvsispqdlkWK6b7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./john-cena-the-greatest-wwe-fighter-of-all-time.html><span>←</span><span>John Cena: The Greatest WWE Fighter of All Time</span></a>
