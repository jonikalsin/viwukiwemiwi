Warm sun feed me up
I’m leery loaded up
Loathing for a change
And I slip some
Boil away
Swallowed, followed
Heavy about everything
But my love
Swallowed, sorrowed
I’m with everyone and yet not
I’m with everyone and yet not
I’m with everyone and yet
Just wanna be myself
Hey you said you would love to try some
Hey you said you would love to die some
