Johnny’s in the basement
Mixing up the medicine
I’m on the pavement
Thinking about the government
The man in a trench coat
Badge out, laid off
Says he’s got a bad cough
Wants to get it paid off
Look out, kid
It’s somethin’ you did
God knows when
But you’re doin’ it again
You better duck down the alley way
Lookin’ for a new friend
A man in a coon-skin cap</article><article class=post-entry><h2>David Ryan Harris Net Worth</h2><time>Jul 13, 2024</time>

Never got why they tried to market Cardcaptor Sakura to a male audience. DiC didn't do that with Sailor Moon, and guys watched it anyway. (We actually got all the episodes of Cardcaptor Sakura here in Australia, even the ones without the male character - albeit still heavily edited.)Speaking of Sailor Moon...while, there are certain ridiculous changes. I think DiC did a better job then Cloverway. Cloverway did have less censorship than DiC, but the censorship they did have was a lot more awkward than DiC's.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/30/>← Prev Page</a>
