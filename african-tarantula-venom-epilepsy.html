According to the <a href=# rel=noopener>Dravet Foundation</a>, the syndrome typically manifests in the first year of a child’s life and lasts until the end of their life. Children with Dravet syndrome typically suffer from developmental delays as a result of their frequent seizures and have a shortened life span.</p><p>The syndrome is a result of a genetic mutation in the brain that affects sodium channels, specifically the NaV1.1 protein.&nbsp;The exact number of people affected by Dravet syndrome is unknown, but it is estimated that 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 40,000 people are affected.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>IFLScience</a>, professor Steven Petrou of the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, one of the study’s authors, got&nbsp;the idea to conduct this study when he was talking to professor Glenn King of the University of Queensland, an expert on the composition of venoms.</p><p>Children with Dravet syndrome produce only half the NaV1.1 protein, so Petrou was looking for a molecule that could stimulate the NaV1.1 protein. King told him the molecule he was looking for could be found in the venom of a West African tarantula.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-185317 alt="Heteroscodra Maculata" width=900 height=479 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/heteroscodra-maculata.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-185317 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Greg Hume/Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The West African tarantula a.k.a. Heteroscodra maculata.</span></p><p>They used the Hm1a venom peptide to selectively activate the NaV1.1 in the brains of mice with Dravet syndrome. The Hm1a was found to hyper-stimulate the protein that is affected in those with Dravet syndrome.</p><p>“After applying the compound from the spider venom to nerve cells from the brains of Dravet mice we saw their activity immediately return to normal,” Petrou said in a <a href=# rel=noopener>statement</a>. “Infusions into the brains of the Dravel mice not only restored normal brain function within minutes but over three days, we noted a dramatic reduction in seizures in the mice and increased survival. Every single untreated mouse died.”</p><p>While the study made progress in therapy for this form of epilepsy, there is still a significant way to translate this from mice to humans.</p><p>The report states that one of the biggest hurdles is that the Hm1a peptide is unable to pass through a human’s blood-brain barrier and so the delivery of the peptide would need to be invasively injected into the child’s spine.</p><p>Improvements on the tarantula’s peptide will need to be made before researchers can see if the venom could be used in curing Dravet syndrome in humans, but their breakthrough provides a bright spot of hope for the thousands of children suffering from the disease.</p><p>Next, check out these <a href=#>five spider facts</a> that prove just how much we need them.
