But Tom isn’t just a contractor, he’s a father, an author, ex-marine, and a clothing store owner.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This Tom Reber Bio explores everything you need to know about this amazing personality.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Meet Tom Reber, Unfinished Business Host</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>We’ve seen quite a few homeowners trying to tackle renovations themselves until they are forced to give up their DIY dreams. So, this was where </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Unfinished Business</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> stepped in.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As its host, Tom Reber offered support, guidance, and tough love to owners needed to regain control of runaway projects.</span></p><h3><b>Tom Reber Net Worth</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Tom Reber flaunted a net worth of under $1.25 million in 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This home renovation coach worked his magic through his company </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Contractor Fight</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> then. Reportedly, he founded the renovation firm back in November 2012 and has since helped over 1000s of home improvement contractors earn “the respect and dignity equal to the value that they bring to their clients.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>One of their clients, Cobus Breytenbach, said, “I was 30k in debt when I joined the program. Charged the fee to a credit card. Best decision I ever made!”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Aside from managing his renovation company, Tom was also involved in the clothing business at the time. He founded </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Live Unafraid Apparel </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>in Colorado Springs in the Summer of 2020, after wanting to build a clothing brand that “spoke to the fire inside people tired of hiding their light.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But initially, Tom started his career as a marine. He served the US Marine Corps for 4 years until he was honorably discharged in 1992.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Penning his years of experience, Tom published a book called “Winning the Contractor Fight” in September 2021. It sold for $14.99 on Amazon.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, he spread his will to “fight” over an apple podcast titled “The Contractor Fight with Tom Reber”.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for his education, Tom graduated from</span><i><span style=font-weight:400> Wheaton North High School</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 1987 and joined </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>StrongFirst</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><h3><b>Tom Reber Age</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Tom Reber was 52 years of when he first appeared on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Unfinished Business</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2022.</span></p><h3><b>Is Tom Reber Married?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>No, Tom Reber wasn’t married as of 2022. However, the star was about to, and his fiancee’s name is <a href=#>Lee Unruh</a>. The two were together at least since June 2021 and often featured each other over their IG.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“All the people in my life know the beautiful love story I have with this man. If you don’t know ask me,” Lee shared. Here’s her IG @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>darkhorse2u</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, if you ever intend to.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for Tom, he shared that the “woman who stole his heart” was his “queen” and he loves her more than she will ever know. No wonder, he proposed to her in November 2021, all prepared to take her as his wife.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Talking a little more about his fiancee, Lee (Donaldson) Unruh is a professional hunter, jumper, and equitation trainer who owned </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Unruh Enterprises, Inc</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. Reportedly, she opened the company back in August 2000 in Castle Rock, CO.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, Unruh has two daughters from her past relationship named Maddie and Noel @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>_strange.stuff_</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.

His son, Dakota followed in his dad’s footsteps and was serving the US Marine Corps.</span></p><h3><b>Tom Reber Parents And Siblings</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Tom Reber grew up in a contractor family. His dad was a well-known contractor in Colorado, while not much was known about his mother — except she was “the most influential woman” in Tom’s life.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Unfortunately, Tom’s mother Debbie passed away on February 6, 2021.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>It seems that Debbie and Tom’s fiance Lee were also close to each other. After her death, Lee took it to her IG to write, “Said goodbye to my “mother in love” today. e I love you so much and will miss our talks and text messages.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for Tom’s siblings, he has a sister named Beth Verdico and a brother named Joe.
