It cherishes life pre-technology and the simpler days of the country star’s childhood. The song encompasses Hubbard’s signature pop-country sound and pulls influences throughout the singer + songwriter’s musical interests growing up.</p><p>“I could use a little more wide open&nbsp;/ Back when all I wanted was the hand I was holdin’&nbsp;/ Livin in the moment with the good time crowd, makin’ life count&nbsp;/ Damn I could use a little more back then right now.”</p><p>He says, “I think nostalgia in general is just, a lot of times, it’s good. It’s good feelings and good memories and who doesn’t like that? So I’m hoping that everyone can channel that and that this song kind of takes them to that happy place and that we can sort of infiltrate our current, present-day with things that made us happy.”</p><p>The single follows Hubbard’s wildly successful singles “5 foot 9” and “Dancin’ In The Country” and follows his self-titled debut as a solo artist birthed at the beginning of the year.</p><p>Alongside Hubbard’s reminiscent single, some of our FAVORITE country performers have released a new song for their catalog including&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Chris Stapleton</strong></a>&nbsp;with “Think I’m In Love With You,” <a href=#><strong>Miranda Lambert</strong></a> with “Driving Back There in My Mind,” <a href=#><strong>Dustin Lynch</strong></a> with “Killed The Cowboy,” <a href=#><strong>The Cadillac Three</strong></a> with “Young and Hungry,”<a href=#><strong> Dan + Shay</strong></a> with “For The Both of Us,” <a href=#><strong>Justin Moore</strong></a> with “Selfish Man,” <a href=#><strong>Eric Paslay</strong></a> with “Perfect Stranger” and <strong><a href=#>Naomi Cooke Johnson </a></strong>with “Livin’ Ain’t Killed Me Yet.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Colbie Caillat</strong></a> teamed up with <a href=#><strong>Sheryl Crow</strong></a>&nbsp;for “I’ll Be Here,” <a href=#><strong>Jon Langston</strong></a> teamed up with <a href=#><strong>Travis Denning</strong></a> for “I ain’t Country” off of his brand-new album Heart On Ice &nbsp;and <a href=#><strong>Levi Hummon</strong></a> teamed up with hip-hop songwriter <a href=#><strong>Sam Tinnesz</strong></a> for “Rock Bottom.”</p><p>After releasing a few singles, country rocker <a href=#><strong>Ashley McBryde</strong></a>&nbsp;released album The Devil I Know&nbsp;hosting singles, “Women Ain’t Whiskey” and title track “The Devil I Know.”</p><p>Rootsy singer + songwriter <a href=#><strong>Tyler Childers</strong></a>&nbsp;released his seven-track assemblage&nbsp;Rustin’ in the Rain&nbsp;that pays homage to his roots. He describes the release as “a collection of songs I playfully pieced together as if I was pitching a group of songs to Elvis. Some covers, one co-write, and some I even wrote in my best, terrible Elvis impersonation.”</p><p>We’re not done yet!</p><p>That isn’t all of our new favorites.
