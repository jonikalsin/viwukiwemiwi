Tshakoane is said to have evaded the police and his son for some time. However, after Shakoane’s death more than a week ago, Tshakoane unexpectedly regained prominence.

After departing Amakhosi, Tshakoane joined the provincial Safa (South African Football Association) institutions and eventually became president of Safa Ekurhuleni. The 2016 Vuzu TV reality program Rich Kids raised initial concerns regarding the man’s source of wealth.</p><p>His company engages in Bitcoin transactions. Some have referred to him as a swindling artist and a fraud. He previously addressed these allegations.

It became widely known that Louis Jr. Tshakoane was incarcerated. He allegedly denied these allegations on Facebook, claiming he was on vacation in Dubai and not in jail. His identity was used by an unconfirmed account to post the message.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Louis-Tshakoane-2-1.jpg><h2>Undercover Billionaire International Was Founded By Louis Tshakoane.</h2><p>Louis discovered through his business dealings that millionaires and entrepreneurs lacked mutual trust.
