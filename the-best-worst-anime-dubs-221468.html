DiC didn't do that with Sailor Moon, and guys watched it anyway. (We actually got all the episodes of Cardcaptor Sakura here in Australia, even the ones without the male character - albeit still heavily edited.)<p>Speaking of Sailor Moon...while, there are certain ridiculous changes. I think DiC did a better job then Cloverway. Cloverway did have less censorship than DiC, but the censorship they <i>did</i> have was a lot more awkward than DiC's. The most ridiculous change was their attempts to get rid of Haruka and Michiru's relationship. They constantly insisted that Haruka and Michiru were "cousins" (to the point where even Kaolinite and Eudial seem to know that they were "cousins"), yet they left all of their romantic scenes intact. Basically, they took a lesbian couple and turned them into lesbian cousins. Way to go, Cloverway. (On the other hand, it made the Cloverway dub unintentionally funny. Actually, the original English dub of Sailor Moon is unintentionally funny, full stop. There's a YouTube channel called "Sailor Moon Says" that showcases some of the cheesiest moments.)</p><p>As for good dubs...I thought Hamtaro was dubbed surprisingly well for an early 2000s dub. Sure they did change characters' names, but it was actually pretty entertaining.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHy1tMRmmZ6rpGLEsL7SrWSappmism6w1JuqZ2piZoF3hI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nicole-eggert-baywatch-then-now-photos.html><span>←</span><span>See Photos Of Baywatch Star Today Hollywood Life</span></a>
