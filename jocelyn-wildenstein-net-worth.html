She is a well-known New York socialite, recognized for her lavish lifestyle and high-profile divorce from Alec Wildenstein, a wealthy French businessman. Despite the controversy surrounding her surgically altered appearance, she remains a prominent figure in New York social circles at the age of 75.</p><p>With a net worth of $500 million as of 2015, Jocelyn’s wealth primarily stems from her highly publicized divorce from Alec Wildenstein.

However, her profound alteration through facial surgery has also garnered significant media attention.</p><h3>Jocelyn Wildenstein Net Worth $500 Million</h3><p>Born into a middle-class family in Lausanne, Jocelyn was trained as a pilot and gained expertise in hunting during her time in Switzerland. Her introduction to Alec Wildenstein occurred during a shooting weekend at his African ranch, leading to their marriage in 1978. The union lasted for 21 years and produced two children, Diane and Alec Jr.</p><p>Following a highly publicized divorce, during which Jocelyn was awarded $2.5 billion in the settlement along with $100 million as annual alimony for 13 years, she received widespread media attention. This divorce became notorious not only due to the exorbitant sum involved but also for the death threats targeted at the presiding judge, Marilyn Diamond, reflecting the intensity of the situation.</p><p>Jocelyn’s extensive facial surgeries, initially influenced by her ex-husband’s affection for felines, have been a subject of public fascination. Despite the controversies surrounding her altered appearance, she maintains contentment with her choices.
