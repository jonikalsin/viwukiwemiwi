In the footage, shared by CNN, police did not offer a reason as to why the reporter was taken away in handcuffs. Jimenez’s broadcast crew — producer <strong>Bill Kirkos</strong>, and photojournalist <strong>Leonel Mendez</strong> — were also handcuffed and taken into police custody.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><strong>1. What happened?</strong> — Jimenez was on-location in Minneapolis covering the ongoing protests calling for justice in the death of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>George Floyd</strong></a>, 46. CNN said that Jimenez and team identified themselves as reporters and said they’d comply with where the police wanted them to broadcast. Floyd died after being restrained by officer <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Derek Chauvin</strong></a>, who was charged with his murder on May 29. Chauvin and the three other police officers involved in the case were fired after a video of Chauvin with his knee on Floyd’s neck went viral.&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</i></p><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong>2. Omar and his colleagues have since been released.</strong> — CNN confirmed the release of its employees on Twitter at 7:58 AM on May 29. The tweet included a video of Omar explaining the situation in a live broadcast, in which he called the arresting officers “cordial.” Omar recalled, “As far as the people that were leading me away, there was no animosity there, they weren’t violent with me. We were having a conversation about just how crazy this week has been for every single part of the city,” he said. Omar also inquired about the proper guidelines his broadcast team should follow while reporting on the protests in Minnesota. He said an unnamed officer replied, “Look, I don’t know man, I’m just following orders.” Omar also shared a photo of him reporting at the protests captioned, “I’m back,” on Instagram, following his arrest.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>CNN’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@OmarJimenez</a> and his crew have been released from police custody.
