Some belly button rings come with double, triple, and quadruple belly piercings. Different types of belly button ring types come in different styles, hence the placement of the jewelry is something that you must take into consideration. For instance, you might be more interested in a top-down belling ring if you have a lower belly piercing that comes with the charm at the bottom of the barbell instead of the top.</p><h4>Size</h4><p>The size of the belly button ring is one of the most important features to consider to ensure that it fits. The majority of belly button rings are 14 gauge with a 7/16 inch shaft, but you can also find bigger and smaller sizes than these. Choosing a proper size not only ensures a comfortable fitting but also minimizes the risk of rejection, infection, migration, and other similar issues.</p><p>Never purchase a “cute” belly ring that isn’t available in your size. The best way to pick the right size is to find out what you are pierced with or your current size.</p><h4>Quality</h4><p>People tend to overlook the importance of choosing jewelry that is safe and hypoallergenic. Cheap belly button rings are usually made from low-quality materials and don’t only break easily but also increase the chances of infections significantly. It is essential that you choose good-quality jewelry from a reliable brand. This doesn’t imply that you’d need to spend hundreds of dollars on your belly ring. You can find countless decent options at a great price. But, it is essential to know what a good quality navel ring is when you see it.</p><h3>What Type of Material Are Belly Button Rings Made Of?</h3><p>Belly button rings are made from different types of materials. Not all of them are safe and skin-friendly, however. Some of the safest materials for belly button rings include:</p><h4>Surgical stainless steel</h4><p>Surgical stainless steel is one of the safest and most commonly used materials for belly button rings. These have a low irritant or allergic sensitizing potential and are usually very inexpensive and durable. Keep in mind, however, that they are heavier than other choices but still best for the job.</p><h4>Titanium</h4><p>Titanium is another durable option for belly button rings. These are mostly used by people who don’t feel comfortable wearing surgical steel or are allergic to nickel. Since titanium has hypoallergenic properties, there are fewer chances of your body rejecting titanium belly button rings.</p><h4>Gold</h4><p>Gold is a popular choice for belly rings because of its general aesthetic. It is also generally considered a safe metal with fewer chances of your body rejecting gold jewelry. If you do choose a gold belly ring, make sure it's at least 14 karats since anything less than that can be too brittle and prone to breaking.</p><h3>Picking the Right Belly Button Ring</h3><p>To pick the right belly button ring for yourself, you must keep the following factors in mind:</p><h4>Placement</h4><p>Are you looking for a unique navel piercing or a traditional belly button above your navel?
