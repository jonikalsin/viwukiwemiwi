He was the only true freshman to receive this honor. He was named to the ‘First-Team All-AAC‘ in both 2020 and 2021 as well. AAC is an American collegiate athletic conference that features 11 member universities and 5 affiliate member universities that compete in the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association)’s Division I.</li><li>In his junior season (2021), he was named a ‘Consensus All-American’ and helped The University of Cincinnati become the first ‘Group of 5’ team to reach the College Football Playoff (an annual postseason knockout invitational tournament that determines a national champion for the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (the highest level of college football in the United States)).</li><li>The ‘Group of 5’ includes the conferences whose members are part of the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision. For his performances in the 2021 season, Sauce Gardner was also named the ‘AAC Defensive Player of the Year’.</li><li>After the New York Jets selected him in the 2022 NFL Draft, he signed a 4-year rookie contract with the team in May 2022. In the 2022 NFL season, he led the league in passes defended (PD); with 20 to his name. For the statistic to be recorded, ​the defender has to get his hand on the ball to disrupt the pass.</li><li>He was given the nickname ‘Sauce’ by a youth football coach, when he was about 6 years old, due to his abilities on the field of play. In 2022, he partnered with Buffalo Wild Wings (an American casual dining restaurant and sports bar franchise that specializes in buffalo wings and sauces) and endorsed a sweet and spicy barbecue sauce of theirs called the ‘Sauce sauce’.</li><p>Featured Image by Sauce Gardner / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqyYrpuVYrSivsOnnKtn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nike-end-sponsorship-of-manchester-united-forward-mason-greenwood-following-rape-and-assault-allegations.html><span>←</span><span>Nike end sponsorship of Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood following rape and assault allegat</span></a>
