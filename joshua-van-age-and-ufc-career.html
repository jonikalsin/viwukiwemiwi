Known as “The Fearless,” this 5 feet 5 inches (1.65 m) tall newcomer from Houston, Texas, has shown fearlessness in the Octagon regardless of the opponent. His recent victory against Kevin Borjas at UFC 295 brought his MMA record to 9-1, marking a significant achievement in his career. Originally from Myanmar, Van has been based in Houston since the age of 12 when his family relocated.</p><p>As an American citizen, Van competes in the MMA flyweight class and began his professional career with Fury FC. With 8 fights under his belt since his debut in 2021, he has only suffered one loss. At 21, Van joined the UFC for a short-notice match in June 2023, securing his first win with a split decision against Zhalgas Zhumagulov and making history as the first Burmese-born fighter to win in the UFC.</p><h2>Joshua Van’s Age and Background</h2><p>“The Fearless,” born on October 10, 2001, in Hakha, Myanmar, spent his early years with his siblings in his home country before his family moved to Malaysia due to political unrest. The family later settled in Houston, Texas, when he was 11 years old. In 2023, Van turned 22 and holds American nationality with an Asian ethnicity. While he does not have a Wikipedia page, his remarkable achievements in MMA indicate that he may have one in the future. Meanwhile, his fights and statistics can be found on sports-specific websites like UFC.com.</p><h2>Joshua Van’s Entry into MMA</h2><p>Van’s interest in MMA stemmed from a need for self-defense, particularly during his early days in the United States where he faced bullying as a non-English speaking immigrant. Initially, he longed to return to Myanmar but eventually developed an affinity for fighting, inspired by martial arts icon Bruce Lee. He delved into MMA when introduced by friends at the age of 16/17, ultimately solidifying his passion for the sport after witnessing the Conor McGregor vs. Floyd Mayweather fight. His journey led him to meet instructor Scott Juarez, guiding him to where he is today.</p><h2>Joshua Van’s MMA Journey and UFC Debut</h2><p>Van’s UFC debut came on June 24, 2023, at UFC on ABC: Emmett vs. Topuria, where he triumphed over Zhalgas Zhumagulov in a split decision victory, making history as the first Myanmar-born fighter to win a UFC bout. His second UFC fight at UFC 295 against Kevin Borjas reaffirmed his prowess as he secured a unanimous decision victory after a rigorous bout. Before his UFC venture, Van had a successful stint at Fury FC, winning 7 out of 8 fights, including 5 by KO and 2 in the first round.</p><h3>Related posts:</h3><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmihqKuYqq5uwsCnZJqflWKur7CMrp2cZZOWv6ax0Wg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./firas-zahabi.html><span>←</span><span>Firas Zahabi - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Nationality, Facts</span></a>
