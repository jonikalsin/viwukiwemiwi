The beloved Kevin Costner classic receives our full endorsement as the funniest depiction of minor league baseball ever made, even if a few questions always have persisted since first seeing it over 30 years ago."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Susan Sarandon also stars as Annie Savoy, a lifelong baseball groupie who romances and also imparts wisdom to LaLoosh, although Crash ultimately gets the girl in the end.</p><p>“Bull Durham” — ranked the No.5 sports movie all time by the American Film Institute — even might have earned our first perfect rating in this series. But like many sports flicks, there are a few plot points that only would happen through the Hollywood lens.</p><p>For instance, we are told that LaLoosh strikes out 18 and walks 18 — both league records! — in his first professional start, which would be a minimum of 126 pitches and likely closer to 200. No chance, even then.</p><p>Also, after overcoming several poor starts, under Crash’s and Annie’s tutelage Nuke finally wins a few games and immediately gets the call to make the direct jump from Single-A to the majors?</p><p>As Davis would advise, “Don’t think. It can only hurt the ballclub.”</p><p><strong>Quote of Note:</strong> “OK, well, candlesticks always make a nice gift, and maybe you could find out where she’s registered and maybe a place-setting or a silverware pattern. OK, let’s get two!” — pitching coach Larry Hockett (Robert Wuhl), discussing the upcoming wedding of one of the players during a meeting on the mound.</p><p><strong>Botte Blows:</strong> 4.7 of 5</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3F7j21maW5fl8KtuIydrKugkaJ6qr%2BMp5yaql2lsrOyxJyrZqugpL%2B1v4ympq%2BhlWLEpnnSraClpF2drrexjKqsnquknryvv4yamaitpGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=next href=./cam-taits-obituary-how-did-he-die-journalist-cause-of-death-explore.html><span>Cam Taits Obituary: How Did He Die?
